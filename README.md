Greetings! I am Hyukjun Kwon, a Ph.D. candidate in economics at Rutgers University. My research interests lie in high-dimensional models, machine learning, factor analysis, and causal inference. In particular, my ongoing research focuses on estimation and statistical inference in high-dimensional models. I am on the 2023-24 job market.
